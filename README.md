# Data Science Capstone
### Overview
This capstone project used a Random Forest model to predict whether a home is “luxury” based on housing and neighborhood features. The goal was to automate manual labeling and find the key factors that influence luxury classification.

### Luxury Home Classification – Random Forest Model
- Built and fine-tuned a Random Forest classifier, reaching about 90% accuracy, precision, and recall on test data
- Found that price, past sale price, square footage, and renovation quality were the most important features
- Recommended the model for use in real estate to help automate luxury labeling, and suggested adding features like interior quality or views for future improvements
