# D606-Data-Science-Capstone
### Overview
This capstone project builds and tunes a Random Forest classifier to predict whether homes are classified as "luxury" using housing and neighborhood features, aiming to automate manual labeling and highlight key drivers.

### Luxury Home Classification â€“ Random Forest Model
- Developed a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning, achieving ~90% accuracy, precision, and recall on unseen test data.
- Identified price, previous sale price, square footage, and renovation quality as the top predictors of luxury homes.
- Recommended the model for real estate agencies to automate luxury classification, and suggested expanding the dataset with subjective features (e.g., interior quality, views) for future research.
